## Advertising Campaign Data Analysis

This project streamlines the process of integrating material cost information across multiple advertising platforms. 
Ads are created using various materials and uploaded to different platforms, where clients are charged each time a user clicks on an ad.

### Project Component

`material_cost_statistics_by_month.py` 
- Identifies the date when the cost of each material reaches a specified threshold.

`material_info_collection.py`
- Aggregates material information from four different platforms into a unified table.

`material_total_cost.py`
- Calculates the cumulative cost for each material and updates the table accordingly.

### Purpose and Impact

This project contributes to the development of an interactive dashboard that dynamically displays key financial metrics, including:

- Total cost and gross margin
- Material counts
- Trends in cost fluctuations over time
  
By centralizing and analyzing material cost data, this project enhances cost tracking, decision-making, and overall campaign efficiency.

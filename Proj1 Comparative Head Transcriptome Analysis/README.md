## Project 1 Comparative Head Transcriptome Analysis in *Drosophila elegans* Species Subgroup

### Dataset 
- *Drosophila elegan* genome: [link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCA_018152505.1/)
- *Drosophila gunungcola* genome: [link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCF_025200985.1/)

### Overview
This project investigated differential gene expression patterns and associated functions in the heads of Drosophila elegans and Drosophila gunungcola, 
two species with distinct mating behaviors:

- *D. elegans* exhibits both **wing spots** and **mating display**.
- *D. gunungcola* lacks both traits.

By analyzing transcriptome data, this study aims to identify genes involved in species-specific mating traits.

### Project Component

- Quantified gene expression in both sexes at two life stages (day 0 and day 5) for both species.
- Preprocessed, indexed, and aligned 40 transcriptome libraries using high-performance computing clusters.
- Assessed data quality and visualize gene count data using:
  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA) plots
  - Pearson correlation heatmaps
  - Hierarchical clustering
- Identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and their associated functions using two-way ANOVA with interaction effects.

### Purpose and Impact

The analysis successfully identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with species-specific mating traits. 
Several genes were found to be significantly upregulated in *D. elegans*, potentially contributing to the presence of wing spots and mating display behaviors. 
Functional enrichment analysis revealed key biological pathways involved in neural signaling, pigmentation, and courtship behavior.

These findings enhance our understanding of the genetic basis of mating trait evolution in the Drosophila elegans species subgroup and 
provide a foundation for further functional validation studies.
